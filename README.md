# Aglarond

Aglarond was *Fourth Dimension Studio Third Game - Aglarond - A Roguelike with enhanced Game Feel*

Aglarond was a game I (Guilherme de Oliveira) was working on my side while attending my Master's in Game Design, the game is no longer being developed and I decided to make it open source because I believe many developers can be helped by taking a look at the code maybe?

The Turn Based System I came up with was an iteration that happened through three different roguelite/roguelike projects and I'm very proud of it. The Dungeon Generation System saw many changes until it got to what it was today, and even for Aglarond it was very incomplete.

Postmortem posts are being written for the Turn Based System and for my Roguelike development in general.
